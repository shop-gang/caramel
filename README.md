Fluid and magic-like crafting of stunningly unique, personalized, printable calendars using Generative AI.

## Overview

ChronosCraft AI is a web application where users co-create beautiful, personalized, printable calendars with the help of Generative AI. The project is split into two main parts:

- [`client/`](./client): Frontend (React/Next.js) – user experience, design, and GenAI-powered creative features.
- [`server/`](./server): Backend (Node.js/Express) – API orchestration, persistence, and integration with AI services.

For detailed technical and product documentation, see the respective `README.md` files in each subdirectory.

## Quick Start

1. Set up your development environment (see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`)
2. Install dependencies for both client and server
3. Start the development servers

## Documentation

- 📚 `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - Setup and configuration guide
- 🔧 `docs/API.md` - API documentation and endpoints
- 👥 `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development workflow and guidelines
- 📝 `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes

## Project Structure

```
client/      # Next.js frontend
server/      # Express backend

```

For detailed configuration and setup instructions, see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.

## Technology Vibe

- **Frontend:** Modern, component-based JS framework (React/Next.js). Focus on a clean, responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Scalable platform (Node.js/Express). Ready to orchestrate multiple API calls.
- **Database:** For a balance of structure and flexibility (PostgreSQL/JSONB).
- **AI:**
  - **Default:** Use Google's Gemini for both text and image generation.
  - Leverage best-in-class third-party APIs for core GenAI (image generation, possibly LLM for assistant). Build custom logic for agent orchestration and workflow, not foundational models.
  - Optionally support use of [GitHub Models](https://github.com/features/models) to find and experiment with AI models for free.
- **PDF Generation:** Use a proven, robust library (implementing both, but for v0.1 the focus is on pdf-lib; puppeteer for HTML-to-PDF is to be an addition for V1.0 -- make it work).
- **Persistence:** Standard database for user accounts, projects, preferences, asset metadata.

## Secrets & Sensitive Data

- All sensitive configuration (API keys, credentials, etc.) must be managed using [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) only. **Do not commit secrets to the repository or use alternative secret management systems.**

## Environment Variables & .env Usage

- For local development, copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and fill in the required values.
- The dev container and Codespaces support environment variables out of the box.
- Do not commit secrets or sensitive values to the repository.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details on environment variable management.
